Chaos Monkey is a tool to randomly turn off and on AWS EC2. It is directly inspired by [Netflix's account](http://techblog.netflix.com/2010/12/5-lessons-weve-learned-using-aws.html) of such script used to make sure that their cloud infrastructure could handle failures. There wasn't a public version of it, so I made my own. It's a total hack made for [The Next Web Hackathon](http://hackathon.thenextweb.com/index.php/Main_Page), so you'll want to to poke around a bit before running it on anything. You'll probably at least need to change the AWS region.
